# Hosting a Static Website on AWS S3

This project demonstrates how to host a simple static website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 storage service. The website consists of basic HTML and an image, and this guide walks you through the steps to make it publicly accessible via the internet. This is a great way to host basic websites with text, images, and other multimedia content.

## Overview

### Website Creation
- Created a simple static website with basic HTML and an image.
- All necessary files, including `index.html` and image assets, are prepared for deployment.

### Setting Up AWS S3
- Logged into the AWS Management Console and navigated to S3.
- Created a new S3 bucket with default settings to host the website.
- Uploaded all website files, including HTML and images, into the S3 bucket.

### Enabling Static Website Hosting
- Configured the S3 bucket to enable static website hosting.
- Set the `index.html` as the main entry point for the website.

### Making the Website Publicly Accessible
